# Ethos Labs

### Vision: increase ethical profits <a href="#vision-increase-ethical-profits" id="vision-increase-ethical-profits"></a>

A rising tide lift all boats. We all prosper when we can exchange goods and services reliably. Unethical behavior is a drain on markets, increasing risk, reducing participation, and making us all poorer in the end.

With Ethos, opportunities will flow towards those with a long standing ethical history. Scammers, grifters, and the unethical will find it expensive, risky, and time consuming to fake these signals. Ethos increases investment in the ethical and increases expenses for the unethical.

### Mission: crypto participation requires credibility

> Trust is essential for society to function—our civilization would collapse completely without it—and the fact that we don’t think about it is a measure of how well that trust works.
>
> \-- Bruce Schneier, [Trust and Society](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2013/02/trust_and_society.html)

Everyone wins when checking credibility is universal. A lack of credibility evidence will be suspicious.

It should be so easy, so commonplace to build and maintain a reputation on chain that there will be no excuse not to do so. When it's so automatic that we barely think about it, the crypto market will mature to the point where scams are rare and obvious.&#x20;

In the not-so distant future, we assume nobody will take you seriously until you have an Ethos profile.
