# Invite

An **invitation** is required to create an Ethos profile.&#x20;

Invitations create a bond between an inviter and the invitee's credibility score for the first 90 days.

Invitations help us ensure a sybil resistant network where users risk their own social capital in who they invite.

### How invitations work

An existing user may use the invite function of the Ethos protocol to invite another Ethereum address. Invitations are intended to be limited, and their initial distribution will be managed by the Ethos Labs team.&#x20;

Invitations from credible users increase new user's score significantly.&#x20;

Invitations can be revoked if they have not been accepted yet.

### The invitation bond

There is a 90 day bonding period when someone accepts your invitation. During this time you will earn 20% of their score, positive OR negative.&#x20;

This is intended to create some both upside and downside in your social capital by being selective in who you invite.&#x20;

If a user invites a bad actor, who's score drops dramatically in the 90 day bonding period, the invitee will lose some of their credibility score as well.&#x20;

This discourages people from inviting bad actors.. or potentially themselves. It encourages people to invite credible, reputable people as they will also earn credibility score from it.
