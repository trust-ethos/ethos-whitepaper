# Slash

**Slashing** fines unethical behavior.

{% hint style="info" %}
Slashing is not currently live in the Ethos. It will be added at a later date. \
The exact parameters of how Slashing works are subject to change before launch.
{% endhint %}

### Social Validation

In the Ethereum Proof of Stake consensus protocol ([Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/)), with sufficient staked Ethereum (currently 32Ξ), one may act as a validator. Validators verify the accuracy and security of transactions and receive rewards for their efforts. Validators may act as a "[whistleblower](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/an-ethereum-stakers-guide-to-slashing-other-penalties)" and highlight an inaccurate or insecure transaction for extra validation, with various rewards and fees.&#x20;

Today in Ethos, you become eligible to validate and participate in slashing events if you have a minimum of 2Ξ staked cumulative across any Ethos profiles; this minimum is subject to change as we evaluate validator participation.

### Slashing - Financial

Any Ethos participant may act as a "whistleblower[^1]" to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused.&#x20;

The whistleblower requests human validation by pledging a nominal reward to validators. Validators vote to indicate if they found the claims valid. Validators are rewarded the same whichever way they vote.&#x20;

If validators vote in favor of the whistleblower, they reward the whistleblower pledged to validators is reimbursed _from the amount staked by the accused._ This is the "slashing punishment," and it cannot exceed 10% of the total amount staked in Ethos (as of writing)

**This is the&#x20;**_**only**_**&#x20;way in which staked funds may be withdrawn without the explicit approval of the person staking those assets.** It is intended to be rare; most unethical behavior can be reported first by a negative review or unvouching.

Upon being slashed the accused has a 72h grace period before they may be slashed again.

### Slashing - Social

Ethos users can also create "Social Slashings" where instead of actual capital risked, they risk their own social capital in the form of their credibility score. The slashing follows a similar process of voting and validation for their claim.
