# Credibility Consensus

For the reasons described in Ethos Governance Principles, the Ethos [credibility-score.md](../ethos-mechanisms/credibility-score.md "mention") is uses collective input from community members with our Ethos Improvement Proposal program.

Measuring credibility will be inherently difficult, and everyone will have their own differing opinion on how to weight what goes into calculating that credibility. It's important to understand that during the early period of the protocol, the goal is to push Ethos' credibility model forward _collectively,_ through _consensus._ The initial scoring model is likely to overvalue some parameters, undervalue others, and completely miss parameters the team hasn't yet thought of. This allows us to collectively define that as a community and make sure we optimize the scoring system before Ethos progresses to general availability.

### Governance-lite

For all credibility score changes, we poll all users of Ethos on their input as to if they agree or not to the proposed changes. 

While this is not a rigorous implementation of DAO governance, it ensures that Ethos is aligned with what changes the community wants to see in the protocol.

The constant friction with credibility score changes is that most users will act in their own self interest over the interest of the overall protocol. Ethos' credibility scores must be accurate for everyone, not exclusively beneficial to a specific voter. 

In the early days of the protocol, Ethos will remain in full control of implementation and delivery of all Ethos Improvement Proposals. Ethos may choose to throw proposals out, implement proposals differently, or go against consensus in order to ensure future success of Ethos.

We intend to consider more traditional DAO like governance once the product and protocol further mature.
